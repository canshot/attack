    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>&nbsp;is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</p>
    <p>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled</p>
    <p>it to make a type specimen book. <a href="http://www.nyt.com" target="_blank">It has survived not only five centuries,</a></p>
    <p>but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
    <p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem</p>
    <p>Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software</p>
    <p>like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
