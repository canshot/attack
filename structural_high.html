            Structural behavior</h1><br>

The structural behavior concerns manipulating the structural elements of the emails, such as email address and sent time. This behavior consists of five specific behaviors.
          <br><br> 
          
          1.<br><div class="box">The first behavior involves using link-embedding words. You can think of the words with a link including ‘click here’, ‘log in’, or ‘update’. When email receivers click the link-embedding words, they can go to another web page.</div> 
          <br>
          2.<br><div class="box">The second link behavior is using specious link. You can insert a link that contains a fake URL address as the following example. <strong>“Refer to the NYT article to read their corruption (www.nytime.net/article/12543).”</strong></div>
          <br>
          3.<br><div class="box">The first structural behavior involves using a fake group email address. For example, <strong>All_student_announcement@uncc.edu</strong> is a fake group email address.</div> 
         <br>
          4.<br><div class="box">The second structural behavior involves sent time manipulation. For instance, you may notice the sent time as an unusual one. A business email sent <strong>at 03:35 AM</strong> is very uncommon.</div> 
        <br>
          5.<br><div class="box">The third structural behavior is using email address falsification to make a spurious impression to the receivers. For example, by using a fake email address, such as <strong>insurance@car.com</strong>, or <strong>bestheadhunter@linkedin.net</strong>, email senders can allude to that he or she holds domain expertise, which attempts to hoax email receivers.</div>
