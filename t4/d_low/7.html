<li>The receiver may be aware of the behaviors that you will learn and when he/she makes detection decisions of phishing emails.</li>
<br><li>Therefore, to be successful in a phishing attack, you should try your best to <strong>RESTRICT yourself from displaying those behaviors </strong> while staying on the topic.</li>

<h1 align="center">Discourse behavior</h1>  
    
          
          <h3 align="left">
          The discourse can be defined as a sequence of sentences that have internal relations to themselves as well as external to other sentences. The discourse behavior concerns linking part of a message in online interaction to the entire message as a whole that looks beyond individual sentences. There are two specific behaviors. 
          <br><br> 
          
          <strong>Mismatch subject</strong>
          <br><div class="box">The subject line of an email is irrelevant or does not match the content in the body of the email. For example, the subject line of an email is <em>“Time Sensitive Refund Notification from Amazon”</em>, BUT the content of the email body is about a credit card promotion.</div> 
          <br>

          <strong>Disguised sentence</strong>
          <br><div class="box">An email sender disguises the subject line and the content of an email as a reply to the email receiver. For instance, the body of an email starts with the sentence, <em>“This email is in response to the message that you sent yesterday.”</em> </div>
          <br>

          <strong>Salutation & Subscription</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior involves a phatic communication in routine greeting addressed to the email receiver such as <em>‘dear’, ‘sir’,</em> etc. Also, this behavior includes the closure of an email as a formal correspondence such as <em>‘Your sincerely’ or ‘Best regards’</em>. The salutation and subscription follow similar narrative features.</div>
          <br>

          <strong>Discourse initiation</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior involves the introduction of the email sender to the email recipient such as <em>‘My name is Alice Joe from UK.’</em></div>
          <br>

          <strong>Enticing information</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior involves persuasive narratives by the email senders with the intention to convince the email receivers to be interested in the conversation such as <em>‘I am a woman who was diagnosed for cancer about 4 years ago and I have decided to donate my fund.’</em></div>
          <br>

          <strong>Request to further discussion</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior involves the act of asking or employing email recipients to do something by responding to emails received to indicate interest or give more information on personal details with the intention to facilitate further discussions such as <em>‘reply me with your resume and I will give you more details if you show more interest.’</em></div>
          <br>
