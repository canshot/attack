<ul>

<li>The receiver may be aware of the behaviors that you will learn and when he/she makes detection decisions of phishing emails.</li>
<br><li>To be successful in a phishing attack, you should try your best to <strong>RESTRICT yourself from displaying those behaviors </strong> while staying on the topic.</li>

<h1 align="center">Structural behavior</h1>     
          
          <h3 align="left">
          The structural behavior concerns manipulating the structural elements of the emails, such as email address and sent time. This behavior consists of five specific behaviors.
          <br><br> 
          
          <strong>Link-embedding words</strong>
          <br><div class="box">You can think of the words with a link including <em>‘click here’, ‘log in’, or ‘update’</em>. When email receivers click the link-embedding words, they can go to another web page.</div> 
          <br>

          <strong>Deceptive link</strong>
          <br><div class="box">Deceptive link is the technique in which the phisher includes the full address of a fake link in the email. You can insert a link that contains a suspicious address like the following example. <em>“Refer to the NYT article to read their corruption on  www.nytime.net/article/12543.”</em></div>
          <br>

          <strong>Multiple body parts</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior involves multiple body parts more than one paragraph in the email body.
         </div>
          <br>
 
          <strong>Unusual sent time</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior involves the sent time manipulation. For instance, you may use an unusual sent time, such as <em>3:35 am</em>.</div> 
          <br>
          
          <strong>Email address with a suspicious domain</strong>
          <br><div class="box">The suspicious domain is the falsification technique in which the phisher includes an unverified domain in the sender’s email address. For example, by using a fake email address, such as <em>insurance@car.com</em>, or <em>bestheadhunter@linkedin.net</em>, email senders can allude to that he or she holds domain expertise, which attempts to hoax email receivers.</div>
