        <strong>Phishing Behavior Training (final)</strong></h1><br>

<h1 align="center">Lexical behavior</h1>      
          
          <h3 align="left">
          Lexical behavior involves using specific words, terms, or verbs in a message 
          to enhance the sender’s intention to mislead a receiver. This type consists of 
          four specific behaviors.
          <br><br> 

          <strong>First person singular pronoun</strong>
          <br><div class="box">First-person singular pronoun indicates pronouns such as I, my, me. For example, you can think of a sentence like, 
          <em>“I’m pretty sure that this information can help you a lot.”</em> In this sentence, “I” is a first-person pronoun for the lexical behavior.</div> 
          <br>

          <strong>Generalizing terms</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior involves using generalizing terms such as everyone, all, anybody. For example, in the sentence, <em>“Everyone believes that our economy will improve next year”</em>, a generalizing term ‘everyone’ is used.</div> 
          <br>

          <strong>Exclusive words</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior involves using exclusive words such as ‘but, except, without.’ For example, in the sentence, <em>“Benefit is clear without loss”</em>, an exclusive word ‘without’ is used.</div> 
          <br>
          </h3>
          
<h1 align="center">Structural behavior</h1>     
          
            <h3 align="left">
            The structural behavior concerns manipulating the structural elements of the emails, such as email address and sent time. This behavior consists of five specific behaviors.
            <br><br> 
            
            <strong>Link-embedding words</strong>
            <br><div class="box">You can think of the words with a link including <em>‘click here’, ‘log in’, or ‘update’</em>. When email receivers click the link-embedding words, they can go to another web page.</div> 
            <br>

            <strong>Deceptive link</strong>
            <br><div class="box">Deceptive link is the technique in which the phisher includes the full address of a fake link in the email. You can insert a link that contains a link that poses as another legitimate link, as shown in the following example - <em>“Refer to the NYT article to read their corruption on www.nytime.net/article/12543.”</em></div>
            <br>

            <strong>Multiple body parts</strong>
            <br><div class="box">This behavior involves multiple body parts and/or more than one paragraph in the email.
          </div>
            <br>

            <strong>Unusual sent time</strong>
            <br><div class="box">This behavior involves the manipulation of sent time. For instance, you may send an email at unusual time such as <em>3:35 am</em>.</div> 
            <br>
            
            <strong>Suspicious domain in email address</strong>
            <br><div class="box">The suspicious domain is the falsification technique in which the phisher includes an unverified domain in his/her email address. For example, the following fake email address contains suspicious domains such as <em>insurance@car.com</em>, or <em>bestheadhunter@linkedin.net</em>. Email senders can use them to allude he/she holds domain expertise which attempts to hoax email receivers.</div> 
            <br>

            <strong>Salutation & Subscription</strong>
            <br><div class="box">This behavior involves a phatic communication in routine greeting addressed to the email receiver such as <em>‘dear’, ‘sir’,</em> etc. Also, this behavior includes the closure of an email as a formal correspondence such as <em>‘Your sincerely’ or ‘Best regards’</em>. The salutation and subscription follow similar narrative features.</div>
            <br>

            </h3>

<h1 align="center">Discourse behavior</h1>  
    
          
            <h3 align="left">
            The discourse can be defined as a sequence of sentences that have internal relations to themselves as well as external to other sentences. The discourse behavior concerns linking part of a message in online interaction to the entire message as a whole that looks beyond individual sentences. There are two specific behaviors. 
            <br><br> 
            
            <strong>Mismatched subject</strong>
            <br><div class="box">The subject line of an email is irrelevant or does not match the content in the body of the email. For example, the subject line of an email is <em>“Time Sensitive Refund Notification from Amazon”</em>, BUT the content of the email body is about a credit card promotion.</div> 
            <br>

            <strong>Forged reply</strong>
            <br><div class="box">An email sender disguises the subject line and the content of an email as a reply to the email receiver. For instance, the body of an email starts with the sentence, <em>“This email is in response to the message that you sent yesterday.”</em> </div>
            <br>

            <strong>Discourse initiation</strong>
            <br><div class="box">This behavior involves the introduction of the email sender to the email receiver such as <em>‘My name is Alice Joe from UK.’</em></div>
            <br>

            <strong>Enticing information</strong>
            <br><div class="box">This behavior involves persuasive narratives by the email senders with the intention to convince the email receivers to be interested in the conversation as shown in the following example - <em>‘I am a woman who was diagnosed for cancer about 4 years ago and I have decided to donate my fund.’</em></div>
            <br>

            <strong>Request for further discussion</strong>
            <br><div class="box">This behavior involves the act of asking or employing email receivers to do something by responding to emails received to indicate interest or give more information on personal details with the intention to facilitate further discussions as shown in the following example - <em>‘reply me with your resume and I will give you more details if you show more interest.’</em></div>
            <br>

            <strong>Foreshadowing words</strong>
            <br><div class="box">Foreshadowing word is a list of words hinting at the possibility of phishing such as ‘update, confirm, verify, secure, log, click, inconvenient, account, go, carry, run.’ For instance, in the sentence <em>“Click the button below to update your personal information”</em>, the word "click" is used.</div>
            <br>
