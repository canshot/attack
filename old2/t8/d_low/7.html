        <strong>Phishing Behavior Training</strong></h1>

<h1 align="center">Discourse behavior</h1>  
    
          
<h3 align="left">
  The discourse can be defined as a sequence of sentences that have internal relations to themselves as well as external to other sentences. The discourse behavior concerns linking part of a message in online interaction to the entire message as a whole that looks beyond individual sentences. There are two specific behaviors. 
  <br><br> 
  
  <strong>Mismatched subject</strong>
  <br><div class="box">The subject line of an email is irrelevant or does not match the content in the body of the email. For example, the subject line of an email is <em>“Time Sensitive Refund Notification from Amazon”</em>, BUT the content of the email body is about a credit card promotion.</div> 
  <br>

  <strong>Forged reply</strong>
  <br><div class="box">An email sender disguises the subject line and the content of an email as a reply to the email receiver. For instance, the body of an email starts with the sentence, <em>“This email is in response to the message that you sent yesterday.”</em> </div>
  <br>

  <strong>Foreshadowing words</strong>
  <br><div class="box">Foreshadowing word is a list of words hinting at the possibility of phishing such as ‘update, confirm, verify, secure, log, click, inconvenient, account, go, carry, run.’ For instance, in the sentence <em>“Click the button below to update your personal information”</em>, the word "click" is used.</div>
  <br>

  <strong>Discourse initiation</strong>
  <br><div class="box">This behavior involves the introduction of the email sender to the email receiver such as <em>‘My name is Alice Joe from UK.’</em></div>
  <br>

  <strong>Enticing information</strong>
  <br><div class="box">This behavior involves persuasive narratives by the email senders with the intention to convince the email receivers to be interested in the conversation as shown in the following example - <em>‘I am a woman who was diagnosed for cancer about 4 years ago and I have decided to donate my fund.’</em></div>
  <br>

  <strong>Request for further discussion</strong>
  <br><div class="box">This behavior involves the act of asking or employing email receivers to do something by responding to emails received to indicate interest or give more information on personal details with the intention to facilitate further discussions as shown in the following example - <em>‘reply me with your resume and I will give you more details if you show more interest.’</em></div>
  <br>
