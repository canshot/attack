          The discourse can be defined as a sequence of sentences that have internal relations to themselves as well as external to other sentences. The discourse behavior concerns linking part of a message in online interaction to the entire message as a whole that looks beyond individual sentences. There are two specific behaviors. 
          <br><br> 
          
          1.<br><div class="box">The first discourse behavior is using mismatch subjects. That is, the subject line of an email is irrelevant or does not match the content in the body of the email. For example, the subject line of an email is <strong>“Time Sensitive Refund Notification from Amazon”</strong>, BUT the content of the email body is about a credit card promotion.</div> 
          <br>
          2.<br><div class="box">The second discourse behavior is using disguised sentences. With this behavior, an email sender disguises the subject line and the content of an email as a reply to the email receiver. <br>For instance, the body of an email starts with the sentence <strong>“This email is in response to the message that you sent yesterday.”</strong> </div>
