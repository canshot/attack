<h3>
<ul>
  
<!–– topic1 -->
<li>You are asked to compose a phishing email to the receiver based on the following scenario.</li> 

<!-- box -->
<p>
  
  You are disguising and claiming yourself as a Geico insurance counselor (which you are not in reality).   
  <br>
  
  Your task is to draft a phishing email that seemingly introduces the state where women pay more than men do for car insurance premium, but with the actual intention to manipulate the receiver into divulging personal or confidential information via accessing a fake website (similar to that of real Geico).
  <br>
  
  You are provided with the following link of the fake website: https://news.geico.com/2019-11-02 (Copy and paste it into your email)
  <br>

  You have obtained the following information of the email receiver who is interested in car insurance through an unstated practice. You should use the information to personalize your email to enhance its credibility. 

</p>
<!-- box -->

<!–– topic2 -->
<li>In the email, you should leverage the receiver’s information provided to you and direct the receiver to reveal his/her sensitive personal information.</li><br> 
  
<li>You would succeed in this task if the email receiver decides to provide his/her sensitive personal information; you would fail the task if the receiver suspects the email of being phishing.</li>

<br><li>The receiver may or may not be aware of those behaviors that you have learned through the training. Therefore, to be successful in a phishing email, you should try your best to <strong>RESTRICT yourself from displaying those behaviors </strong> while staying on the topic.</li>
<br><li>You are NOT allowed to copy and paste information from external sources.</li>
