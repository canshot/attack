  <ul>
    <li>leverage the information provided about the receiver.</li>
    <li>try your best to avoid showing those behaviors that you just learned about phishing emails.</li>
  </ul>
<br><li>The email receiver will be asked to determine whether your email is phishing or not. One indication of phishing success is that the receiver clicks a link embedded in your email.</li>
<br><li>The receiver may or may not be aware of those behaviors that you have learned through the training. Therefore, to be successful in a phishing email, you should try your best to <strong>RESTRICT yourself from displaying those behaviors </strong> while staying on the topic.</li>
<br><li>You are NOT allowed to copy and paste information from external sources.</li>
