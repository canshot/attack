    <h1>How should I write an authentic email?</h1>
    <br><br>
<h3>
  <li>The email content should be truthful to the best of your knowledge and belief.</li>
  <br><li>The email should communicate information about the assigned topic/event to the receiver. Some of the receivers’ personal information (e.g., name, academic major) has been provided for you to personalize the email.</li>
  <br><li>In addition to the receiver’s information, you will also be provided with a credible source related to the topic of the email. The source can be used as a source of reference in writing the email. Alternatively, you can reference other credible sources of information on the web during the task.</li>
  <br><li>Keep details about the research study confidential. Disclosing your role through any online or offline channels to any third party would compromise the objectives of the study, which will disqualify you from participating in the rest of the study and receiving any reward.  </li>
