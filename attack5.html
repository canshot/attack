<mark>Instructions you need to keep in mind. Please read carefully.</mark>
    <h1>How should I write a phishing email?</h1>
    <br><br>
<h3>
  <li>The phishing email should contain your intention to deceive by misleading a receiver into disclosing his/her personal information (e.g., password and credit card number) </li>
  <br><li>The email should communicate information about the assigned topic/event <strong>with more than 50 words </strong> exploit the receiversâ€™ personal information (e.g., name, academic major) that is provided to you.</li>
  <br><li>You may NOT directly copy/paste the emails found on the Internet.</li>
  <br><li>A successful phishing attack is indicated by successfully deceiving the email receiver without being suspected as a phishing email.</li>
  <br><li>Keep details about the research study confidential. Disclosing your role through any online or offline channels to any third party would compromise the objectives of the study, which will disqualify you from participating in the rest of the study and receiving any reward.  </li>
