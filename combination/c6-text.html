<h1 align="center">Lexical behavior</h1>      
          
          <h3 align="left">
            Lexical behavior involves using specific words, terms, or verbs in a message 
            to enhance the sender’s intention to mislead a receiver. This type consists of 
            four specific behaviors.
          <br><br> 
          
          <strong>1.First person pronoun</strong>
          <br><div class="box">For example, you can think of a sentence like, 
          <strong>“I’m pretty sure that this information can help you a lot.”</strong> In this sentence, “I” is a first-person pronoun for the lexical behavior.</div> 
          <br>

          <strong>2.Interaction requesting words</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behaviorrequests users to take an action with an online account or a link such as 
          ‘update, confirm, verify, secure, log, click, inconvenient, and account.’
          <br><br>For instance, in the sentence <strong>“Click the button below to update your personal information”</strong>, the word "click" is used.</div>
          <br>

          <strong>3.Generalizing terms</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior involves using generalizing terms such as ‘everyone, all, anybody.’
          <br><br>For example, in the sentence, <strong>“Everyone believes that our economy will improve next year”</strong>, 
          a generalizing term ‘everyone’ is used.</div> 
          <br>

         <strong>4.Exclusive words</strong>
         <br><div class="box">This behavior involves using exclusive words such as ‘but, except, without.’
         <br><br>For example, in the sentence, <strong>“Benefit is clear without loss”</strong>, an exclusive word ‘without’ is used.</div> 
         <br>
        </h3>
          
<h1 align="center">Structural behavior</h1>     
          
          <h3 align="left">
          The structural behavior concerns manipulating the structural elements of the emails, such as email address and sent time. This behavior consists of five specific behaviors.
          <br><br> 
          
          <strong>1. Link-embedding words</strong>
          <br><div class="box">You can think of the words with a link including <strong>‘click here’, ‘log in’, or ‘update’</strong>. When email receivers click the link-embedding words, they can go to another web page.</div> 
          <br>

          <strong>2. Specious link</strong>
          <br><div class="box">You can insert a link that contains a fake URL address as the following example. <strong>“Refer to the NYT article to read their corruption (www.nytime.net/article/12543).”</strong></div>
          <br>


          <strong>3. Fake group email address</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior involves using a fake group email address. <br><br>For example, <strong>All_student_announcement@uncc.edu</strong> is a fake group email address.</div> 
          <br>
  
          <strong>4. Sent time manipulation</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior involves the sent time manipulation. <br><br>For instance, you may notice the sent time as an unusual one. A business email sent <strong>at 03:35 AM</strong> is very uncommon.</div> 
          <br>
          
          <strong>5. Email address falsification</strong>
          <br><div class="box">This behavior is using email address falsification to make a spurious impression to the receivers. <br><br>For example, by using a fake email address, such as <strong>insurance@car.com</strong>, or <strong>bestheadhunter@linkedin.net</strong>, email senders can allude to that he or she holds domain expertise, which attempts to hoax email receivers.</div> 
          <br>
        
        </h3>

<h1 align="center">Discourse behavior</h1>  
    
          
          <h3 align="left">
          The discourse can be defined as a sequence of sentences that have internal relations to themselves as well as external to other sentences. The discourse behavior concerns linking part of a message in online interaction to the entire message as a whole that looks beyond individual sentences. There are two specific behaviors. 
          <br><br> 
          
          <strong>1. Mismatch subjects</strong>
          <br><div class="box">The subject line of an email is irrelevant or does not match the content in the body of the email. <br><br>For example, the subject line of an email is <strong>“Time Sensitive Refund Notification from Amazon”</strong>, BUT the content of the email body is about a credit card promotion.</div> 
          <br>

          <strong>2. Disguised sentences</strong>
          <br><div class="box">With this behavior, an email sender disguises the subject line and the content of an email as a reply to the email receiver. <br><br>For instance, the body of an email starts with the sentence, <strong>“This email is in response to the message that you sent yesterday.”</strong> </div>
          <br>
