    <h4>The amount of your reward will be based on how well you have followed 
      the instruction on phishing or authentic emails and how successful those emails are. <br><br>
      
<li><strong>The success of a phishing email</strong> will be based on whether it has successfully deceived the receiver by making him/her believe that your email is legitimate/authentic.</li><br> 
<li><strong>The success of an authentic email</strong> will be based on whether it is indeed perceived as authentic by the email receiver.</li>
<br>
The reward will be provided to you after you have completed all the sessions. Those participants who do not follow the instructions during the tasks may forfeit the rewards. Video recording will be used while you are creating authentic and phishing emails
